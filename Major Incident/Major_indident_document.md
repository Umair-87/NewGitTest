# Introduction
The Service Desk is the first point of contact for technical issues faced by internal employees. When a possible Major Incident has been identified, a Major Incident Lead needs to be designated (BizOps Service Desk Lead is the primary Incident Lead for the UK, followed by the BizOps Support Lead, BizOps US Lead for US exclusive MI's).
